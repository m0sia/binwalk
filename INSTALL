BEFORE YOU START
----------------------------------

Although binwalk supports Python 3, Python 2.7 is recommended.

The following installation procedures assume that you are installing binwalk to be run using Python 2.7.
If you want to use binwalk in Python 3, some package names and installation procedures may differ slightly.

You will also need to have a C compiler installed to build some of the supporting libraries.



EASY INSTALL
----------------------------------

Dependency hell sucks, so binwalk ships with an easy_install.sh script that installs *everything*
and should work for most Debian or RedHat based distros:

	$ sudo ./easy_install.sh --sumount

If easy_install.sh didn't work, or if you want to only install the core dependencies, read on.



INSTALLING CORE DEPENDENCIES
----------------------------------

Binwalk has two core dependencies:

	o python-magic
	o pyqtgraph

You can install python-magic from your distro's repositories, or from source (ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/):

	$ sudo apt-get install python-magic

Next, you'll need to install the dependencies for pyqtgraph:
	
	$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-qt4-gl python-numpy python-scipy

Most distros don't have pyqtgraph in their repositories, so you'll need to build it from source:

	$ wget http://www.pyqtgraph.org/downloads/pyqtgraph-0.9.8.tar.gz
	$ tar -zxvf pyqtgraph-0.9.8.tar.gz
	$ cd pyqtgraph-0.9.8 && sudo ./setup.py install



INSTALLING BINWALK
----------------------------------

Binwalk can be installed using the included setup.py installer in the src/ directory:

	$ sudo python ./setup.py install

The installer will check for core dependencies and warn you if any are missing or not compatible.



INSTALLING EXTRACTION UTILITIES
----------------------------------

Binwalk can automatically invoke external extraction utilities to extract various types of files that it
may find during a scan. These utilities are optional, but recommended if you plan on using binwalk's
extraction features.

Most utilities can be installed from your distro's repositories (package names may vary slightly based
on your particular distro):

	$ sudo apt-get install git mtd-utils zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev ncompress gzip bzip2 tar arj p7zip p7zip-full openjdk-6-jdk

However, the Firmware-Mod-Kit, which contains many file system extractors, needs to be built from source
and placed in the /opt/firmware-mod-kit directory:

	$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/firmware-mod-kit
	$ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /opt/firmware-mod-kit
	$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit /opt/firmware-mod-kit/
	$ cd /opt/firmware-mod-kit/src && ./configure && make
